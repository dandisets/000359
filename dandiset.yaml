description: "This data set includes recording from over the rat barrel cortex in
  vivo using high resolution 1024 contact electrodes on the surface of the brain during
  mechanosensory stimulation to both map the barrel cortex as well as validate the
  recording abilities of powerful new conformable surface microelectrodes (platinum
  nanorod contacts). The animals were anesthetized during the procedure and a craniotomy
  was performed. This data is associated with the following publication: \n\nTchoe,
